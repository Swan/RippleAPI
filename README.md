RippleAPI.js is an easy to use wrapper for the Ripple osu! private server API. ðŸŽµ I make requests to the Ripple API practically every single day for a various amount of projects, and it was honestly a pain to have to rewrite the same code a billion times. Thus, I've created a library, for myself and others to use.
