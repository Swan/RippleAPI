RippleAPI.js is an easy to use wrapper for the Ripple osu! private server API. ðŸŽµ I make requests to the Ripple API practically every single day for a various amount of projects, and it was honestly a pain to have to rewrite the same code a billion times. Thus, I've created a library, for myself and others to use. 

# Usage
It's extremely simple to start using RippleAPI.js just by following the steps below.
* Run `npm install rippleapi`

```js
const rippleAPI = require('rippleapi');

rippleAPI.ping()
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      throw new Error(err);
    });
```
